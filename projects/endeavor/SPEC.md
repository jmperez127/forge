# Endeavor: Philosophy-Driven Project Management

> "I live with integrity, build myself, create meaningful work, and protect what matters. (Family. Freedom. Values. Future.)"

## What This Is

A personal operating system. Calm, reflective, intentional. State-based, not task-based.

## What This Is NOT

- Hustle tracker
- Task micromanager
- Gamified dopamine system
- Kanban clone

## The Three Existential States

### THE FORGE
Exploration, discovery, ideation. No deadlines.

**Core Question**: "Is this worth becoming real?"

Projects in The Forge are ideas being tested, concepts being explored. There is no pressure here—only curiosity and possibility.

### THE EMBODIMENT
Commitment, execution, finishing.

**Core Question**: "How do I honor this work fully?"

Projects in The Embodiment have been chosen. You've committed to bringing them to life. This is where craft matters.

### THE CLEARING
Rest, reflection, maintenance.

**Core Question**: "What stays, what changes, what ends?"

Projects in The Clearing are either:
- Completed and being maintained
- Resting while you gather energy
- Being evaluated for archival

## Core Principles

1. **No Tasks, Only Intentions** - You don't track what to do. You hold what you intend.

2. **Transitions Require Reflection** - Moving a project between states is meaningful. It requires thought.

3. **State Over Status** - We don't ask "what's the progress?" We ask "where does this live?"

4. **Calm by Design** - No urgency indicators, no overdue badges, no guilt mechanics.

5. **Weekly Rhythm** - A gentle check-in. What moved? What stalled? How full is The Embodiment?

## Project Properties

Each project holds:
- **Name**: What you call it
- **Meaning**: Why it matters (to you, to others)
- **Develops**: What it builds in you (skills, character, relationships)
- **Intention**: Your current direction (not a task list)
- **State**: Where it lives (Forge, Embodiment, Clearing)
- **Review Date**: When to revisit (optional)

## The Weekly Review

Not a productivity audit. A moment of reflection:
- What moved between states? Why?
- What's stalled? Is that okay?
- How many projects are in The Embodiment? Is that sustainable?
- What do I intend for next week?

## Design Philosophy

- Warm, calm colors (cream, sage, warm grays)
- Generous whitespace
- No bright accent colors screaming for attention
- Typography that breathes
- Transitions that feel intentional, not snappy
